# /direct-cli - Direct CLI Playbook

Use direct `gemini` CLI or Cursor CLI sessions when you want a fresh executor lane outside the usual orchestration runtime, while still keeping Sisyphus-style operator discipline.

## When to Use

- You want a fresh executor session without wrapper state
- You want direct tmux visibility into prompts, thinking, approval blocking, and errors
- You want narrow follow-up work on the current worktree
- You need a recovery playbook for stuck or unhealthy direct CLI lanes

## Operating Model

- Sisyphus stays the conversation owner
- Gemini CLI or Cursor CLI acts as the direct executor
- Tmux pane output is treated as the nearest source of execution truth

## Quick Commands

```text
/direct-cli
/direct-cli gemini
/direct-cli cursor
/direct-cli recovery
```

## Document Map

- `README.md` - human overview and entry guidance
- `playbook.md` - the full preserved direct CLI playbook

## Working Rule

Start from `playbook.md`. Keep prompts narrow, continue from the current worktree only, do not restart from scratch, and trust pane output over assumptions.
